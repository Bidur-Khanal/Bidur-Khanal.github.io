Abstract: The robustness of supervised deep learning-based medical
image classification is significantly undermined by label noise in the
training data. Although several methods have been proposed to enhance
classification performance in the presence of noisy labels, they face some
challenges: 1) a struggle with class-imbalanced datasets, leading to the
frequent overlooking of minority classes as noisy samples; 2) a singular
focus on maximizing performance using noisy datasets, without incor-
porating experts-in-the-loop for actively cleaning the noisy labels. To
mitigate these challenges, we propose a two-phase approach that com-
bines Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) and active learning. This ap-
proach not only improves the robustness of medical image classification
in the presence of noisy labels but also iteratively improves the qual-
ity of the dataset by relabeling the important incorrect labels, under a
limited annotation budget. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Variance
of Gradients approach in the LNL phase, which complements the loss-
based sample selection by also sampling under-represented examples. Us-
ing two imbalanced noisy medical classification datasets, we demonstrate
that our proposed technique is superior to its predecessors at handling
classimbalancebynotmisidentifyingcleansamplesfromminorityclasses
as mostly noisy samples. Code available at: [Bidur-
