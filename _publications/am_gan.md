# Abstract: Multi-domain image-to-image translation with conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate highly photo realistic images with desired target classes, yet these synthetic images have not always been helpful to improve downstream supervised tasks such as image classification. Improving downstream tasks with synthetic examples requires generating images with high fidelity to the unknown conditional distribution of the target class, which many labeled conditional GANs attempt to achieve by adding soft-max cross-entropy loss based auxiliary classifier in the discriminator. As recent studies suggest that the soft-max loss in Euclidean space of deep feature does not leverage their intrinsic angular distribution, we propose to replace this loss in auxiliary classifier with an additive angular margin (AAM) loss that takes benefit of the intrinsic angular distribution, and promotes intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to help generator synthesize high fidelity images. We validate our method on RaFD and CIFAR-100, two challenging face expression and natural image classification data set. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several different evaluation criteria including recently proposed GAN-train and GAN-test metrics designed to assess the impact of synthetic data on downstream classification task, assessing the usefulness in data augmentation for supervised tasks with prediction accuracy score and average confidence score, and the well known FID metric.

Abstract: Scoliosis is a common medical condition, which occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty. Untreated Scoliosis may cause long-term sequelae. Therefore, accurate automated quantitative estimation of spinal curvature is an important task for the clinical evaluation and treatment planning of Scoliosis. A couple of attempts have been made for automated Cobb angle estimation on single-view x-rays. It is very challenging to achieve a highly accurate automated estimation of Cobb angles because it is difficult to utilize x-rays efficiently. With the idea of developing methods for accurate automated spinal curvature estimation, AASCE2019 challenge provides spinal anterior-posterior x-ray images with manual labels for training and testing the participating methods. We review eight top-ranked methods from 12 teams. Experimental results show that overall the best performing method achieved a symmetric mean absolute percentage (SMAPE) of . Limitations and possible future directions are also described in the paper. We hope the dataset in AASCE2019 and this paper could provide insights into quantitative measurement of the spine.
