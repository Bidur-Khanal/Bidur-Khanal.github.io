Label noise in medical image classification
datasets significantly hampers the training of supervised deep
learning methods, undermining their generalizability. The test
performance of a model tends to decrease as the label noise
rate increases. Over recent years, several methods have been
proposed to mitigate the impact of label noise in medical image
classification and enhance the robustness of the model. Predom-
inantly, these works have employed CNN-based architectures as
the backbone of their classifiers for feature extraction. However,
in recent years, Vision Transformer (ViT)-based backbones
have replaced CNNs, demonstrating improved performance
and a greater ability to learn more generalizable features,
especially when the dataset is large. Nevertheless, no prior work
has rigorously investigated how transformer-based backbones
handle the impact of label noise in medical image classification.
In this paper, we investigate the architectural robustness of
ViT against label noise and compare it to that of CNNs. We
use two medical image classification datasets—COVID-DU-Ex,
and NCT-CRC-HE-100K—both corrupted by injecting label
noise at various rates. Additionally, we show that pretraining
is crucial for ensuring ViT’s improved robustness against label
noise in supervised training.
