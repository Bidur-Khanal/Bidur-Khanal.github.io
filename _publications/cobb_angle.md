Abstract: Correct evaluation and treatment of Scoliosis require accu-
rate estimation of spinal curvature. Current gold standard is to manually
estimate Cobb Angles in spinal X-ray images which is time consuming
and has high inter-rater variability. We propose an automatic method
with a novel framework that first detects vertebrae as objects followed
by a landmark detector that estimates the 4 landmark corners of each
vertebra separately. Cobb Angles are calculated using the slope of each
vertebra obtained from the predicted landmarks. For inference on test
data, we perform pre and post processings that include cropping, outlier
rejection and smoothing of the predicted landmarks. The results were as-
sessed in AASCE MICCAI challenge 2019 which showed a promise with
a SMAPE score of 25.69 on the challenge test set.
