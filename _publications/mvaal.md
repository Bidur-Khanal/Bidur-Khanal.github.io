Abstract: Acquiring properly annotated data is expensive in the medical field as it requires experts, time-consuming protocols, and rigorous
validation. Active learning attempts to minimize the need for large annotated samples by actively sampling the most informative examples
for annotation. These examples contribute significantly to improving
the performance of supervised machine learning models, and thus, active learning can play an essential role in selecting the most appropriate
information in deep learning-based diagnosis, clinical assessments, and
treatment planning. Although some existing works have proposed methods for sampling the best examples for annotation in medical image
analysis, they are not task-agnostic and do not use multimodal auxiliary information in the sampler, which has the potential to increase robustness. Therefore, in this work, we propose a Multimodal Variational
Adversarial Active Learning (M-VAAL) method that uses auxiliary information from additional modalities to enhance the active sampling.
We applied our method to two datasets: i) brain tumor segmentation
and multi-label classification using the BraTS2018 dataset, and ii) chest
X-ray image classification using the COVID-QU-Ex dataset. Our results
show a promising direction toward data-efficient learning under limited
annotations.
