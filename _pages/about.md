I'm currently 1st Year PhD Student at Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, Rochester Institute of Technology. 
My research interest includes machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.I am interesed in working in computer vision problems related to domain adaptation, 
self-supervised learning and graph convolutional networks.\

Before starting my Phd, I worked as a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research (NAAMII)](https://www.naamii.com.np/), 
under the co-supervision of [Dr. Bishesh Khanal](https://bishesh.github.io/) and [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://www.naamii.com.np/teams/binod-bhattarai/).
I have good experience working with Object Detection and Segmentation, Generative Adversarial Networks, 2D medical images, and general machine learning algorithms. 
I was also remotely involved as a part-time consultant at [Zeg.ai](https://www.zeg.ai/)- 3D AI solution Company, in R&D of photo-realistic content generation. 
At Zeg, I worked in computer rendered image to natural image translation, keypoint estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction.
