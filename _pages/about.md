Iâ€™m currently 2nd Year PhD Student at Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, Rochester Institute of Technology. 
In general, my research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. I am interested to work in problems that have real world applications and require deeper understanding. I worked with Dr. Christopher Kanan at kLab for a year in investigating impact of heterogeneous label noise in neural networks, and developing efficient online continual learning method capable of learning from single pass through the dataset.

Before starting my Phd, I worked as a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research (NAAMII)](https://www.naamii.com.np/), 
under the co-supervision of [Dr. Bishesh Khanal](https://bishesh.github.io/) and [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://www.naamii.com.np/teams/binod-bhattarai/).
I have good experience working with Object Detection and Segmentation, Generative Adversarial Networks, 2D medical images, and general machine learning algorithms. 
I was also remotely involved as a part-time consultant at [Zeg.ai](https://www.zeg.ai/)- 3D AI solution Company, in R&D of photo-realistic content generation. 
At Zeg, I worked in computer rendered image to natural image translation, keypoint estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction.
