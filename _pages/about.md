Iâ€™m currently a 5th Year PhD Student at the [Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science](https://www.rit.edu/science/chester-f-carlson-center-imaging-science), Rochester Institute of Technology. I work with [Dr. Cristian A. Linte](https://www.rit.edu/directory/calbme-cristian-linte) (main advisor) at Biomedical Modeling, Visualization and Image-guided Navigation Lab (BiMVisIGN). I am also co-advised by [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://sites.google.com/view/bbinod/home) and [Dr. Bishesh Khanal](https://www.naamii.org.np/teams/bishesh-khanal/). Before starting my PhD, I worked at [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.org.np/) (a research institute in Nepal), [Zeg.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zeg-ai/about/) (a 3D AI solution startup), and [NDS](https://nepaldigisys.com/) (an embedded systems and IoT startup). I completed my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Nepal. 


## Research ##

My research focuses on data-driven medical image analysis using deep learning, particularly in scenarios with limited or noisy labeled data. I am interested in solving the challenge of how to create robust deep learning models/frameworks for tasks like medical image classification and segmentation when the available data has limited labels or contains noisy labels. Therefore, my research encompasses areas such as active learning, learning with noisy labels, active relabeling, self-supervised learning, and continual learning.

Through my PhD program, I have also built a strong foundation in Imaging Science, gaining expertise in various areas, including image acquisition, camera design, calibration, image processing, imaging display, human vision, and color science. 



<!-- In general, my research interests include computer vision, deep learning, and medical image analysis. To be specific, I have a strong foundation in imaging systems, active learning, continual learning, label noise in DL and it implications. I am interested to work in problems that have real world applications and generate insightful understanding. I also worked with Dr. Christopher Kanan at kLab for a year in investigating impact of heterogeneous label noise in neural networks, and developing efficient online continual learning method capable of learning from single pass through the dataset. -->

**Interests**: Medical Image Analysis, Learning with Noisy Labels, Active Learning, Continual Learning, Active Relabeling, Self-supervised learning, Multimodal Learning, Vision-Languge Pretraining.

<!-- Before starting my Phd, I worked as a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research (NAAMII)](https://www.naamii.com.np/), 
under the co-supervision of [Dr. Bishesh Khanal](https://bishesh.github.io/) and [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://www.naamii.com.np/teams/binod-bhattarai/).
I have good experience working with Object Detection and Segmentation, Generative Adversarial Networks, 2D medical images, and general machine learning algorithms. 
I was also remotely involved as a part-time consultant at [Zeg.ai](https://www.zeg.ai/)- 3D AI solution Company, in R&D of photo-realistic content generation. 
At Zeg, I worked in computer rendered image to natural image translation, keypoint estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction. -->
