I'm currently a Research Assistant at [NepAl Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research (NAAMII)](https://www.naamii.com.np/). 
My research interest includes machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I am working under the co-supervision of [Dr. Bishesh Khanal](https://bishesh.github.io/) and [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://www.naamii.com.np/teams/binod-bhattarai/).
I have good experience working with Object Detection and Segmentation, Generative Adversarial Networks, 2D medical images, and general machine learning algorithms. I am also remotely involved as a part-time consultant at [Zeg.ai](https://www.zeg.ai/)- 3D AI solution Company, in R&D of photo-realistic content generation. 
My works include computer rendered image to natural image translation, keypoint estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction.
I am interested in joining a Ph.D. program to work in computer vision research (mainly interested in domain adaptation, self-supervised learning, and Graph Convolutional Networks).
